In computer science, a bignum is an objext representing an arbitrary precision 
number. This is useful when you want to store a number bigger than SIZE_MAX
without any loss of precision. This is often achieved by storing the number as
an array or a string containing its different "parts".

Create a class called bigint that will store an arbitrary precision unsigned integer.

Your class must support addition, comparison and "digitshift" (similar to bitshift, but instead of
shifting the bits, you will shift the digits in base 10, e.g.:
(42 << 3 == 42000) and (1337 >> 2 == 13)).

Your bigint must be printable with the << operator (in base 10) and the output should
not contain any leading zeros.

You will find a main in this directory that must work with your class.
